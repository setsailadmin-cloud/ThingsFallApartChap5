                <div class="answer-content">
                    The reader learns that, while women generally maintain a low position in the clan's society, they are important to the clan's religion. Ani, the earth-mother-goddess is portrayed as, perhaps, the most powerful and certainly the most important of the clan's deities. The reader also learns in the section how important the yam is to Umuofia. The yam is celebrated as the main crop of the tribe. A man's importance is determined by his ability to grow yams, so the men take this opportunity to show thanks to the land. Finally, the reader is given another glimpse of Okonkwo's personality. Okonkwo is not comfortable with the celebration because he is unable to work during this time. "But he was always uncomfortable sitting around for days waiting for a feast or getting over it. He would be very much happier working on his farm."

                    Okonkwo becomes angry because one of his wives used part of the banana tree. He beats her in order to satisfy his anger. His anger is not directed in the right place. Okonkwo is angry because he cannot work, and he is simply finding ways to release that anger.

                <div class="answer-content">
                    Okonkwo yells at Ezinma to sit with her legs closed. This exchange happens right before the reader learns how fond Okonkwo is of Ezinma, and also before Okonkwo reminds Ezinma that she is trying to do a boy's job by asking to bring his chair to the wrestling. This might indicate to the reader that sitting with one's legs together has something to do with femininity. Sitting with one's legs together could also refer to a young woman's sexual purity.

                    Such body decoration and hair cutting might seem odd and "primitive" to Achebe's European readers. He is, therefore, trying to establish that, in Ibo culture, these decorations are considered beautiful, not savage.

            <div class="answer">
                <div class="answer-content">
                    Okonkwo compares the sound of the drums with the beating of a heart. "The drums were still beating, persistent and unchanging. Their sound was no longer a separate thing from the living village. It was like the pulsation of its heart. It throbbed in the air, in the sunshine, and even in the trees, and filled the village with excitement." Achebe is explaining that the drums are not something added to the life of the village but are the things that give the village its life, its vitality.
